### üé® **Color Tokens Wizard** ‚ú®

Color tokens can be complex, but with this wizard üßô, you can simplify the process and save time. Start with a HEX value, and the wizard will convert it into RGB, RGBA, or HSL formats in just a few steps. The tokens are ready for use in the Tokens Studio plugin and also provide CSS/SCSS outputs for your developers.

1. **Run the Color Wiz Script**  
   Begin by running the Color Wiz script to start the process. Open your terminal and execute the following command:
   ```sh
   npm run color
   ```

2. **Select a Base Color**  
   Enter a HEX color code (e.g., `#FABADA`).

3. **Define Concept & Modifier**  
   Provide a name for the concept (e.g., `brand`, `background`). Optionally, choose a modifier:
   - **Variant**: (e.g., `primary`, `secondary`, `tertiary`)
   - **Scale**: (e.g., `incremental`, `alphabetical`, or `cardinal` scales)

4. **Generate Color Stops**  
   The script will automatically generate 6 color stops based on your base color:
   - `Lightest`, `Lighter`, `Light`, `Dark`, `Darker`, `Darkest`

5. **Choose Output Formats**  
   By default, your color will be saved in HEX format. You can also choose to generate additional formats:
   - **RGB**
   - **RGBA**
   - **HSL**

6. **Export Color Tokens**  
   The script will export your color tokens in Tokens Studio format, ready for integration into your design system. All JSON files will be prepared for import.

7. **Batch Processing**  
   You can process multiple base colors at once. Provide a list of colors, and the script will generate color tokens for each, creating separate JSON files for each.

8. **Generate CSS & SCSS Files**  
   The script will create CSS and SCSS files with color tokens as variables, saved in the following directories:
   - **CSS**: Stored in `outputs/css/color/color_variables.css`
   - **SCSS**: Stored in `outputs/scss/color/color_variables.scss`

9. **Add More Colors to the Same Group**  
   To add more colors to the existing group, repeat steps 1 and 2. The script will overwrite the existing JSON files in the `tokens/` directory based on your criteria.

### üìè **Size Tokens Wizard** ‚ú®

Managing size tokens can be a daunting task, but with the Size Tokens Wizard üßô, you can streamline the process and save valuable time. Start with a base size, and the wizard will generate a range of size tokens in various units, ready for use in your design system and development projects.

1. **Run the Size Wiz Script**  
   Begin by running the Size Wiz script to start the process. Open your terminal and execute the following command:
   ```sh
   npm run size
   ```

2. **Define the Base Unit**  
   The default base unit for size tokens is pixels (px).

3. **Name Your Size Tokens**  
   Provide a name for your size tokens (e.g., size, spacing, dimension).

4. **Select a Scale**  
   Choose a predefined scale for your tokens:
   - **4px Grid**: Steps increase in increments of 4
   - **8-Point Grid**: Steps increase in increments of 8

5. **Define the Number of Values**  
   Specify how many size values you want to generate (e.g., 6 values for a small-to-large scale).

6. **Choose Naming Criteria**  
   Select a naming pattern for your size tokens:
   - **T-shirt Sizes**: (xs, sm, md, lg, xl)
   - **Incremental Numbers**: (100, 200, 300)
   - **Cardinal Numbers**: (1, 2, 3)
   - **Alphabetical**: (A, B, C or a, b, c)

7. **Generate Size Tokens**  
   The script will generate a list of size tokens based on the chosen scale and naming criteria.

8. **Convert to Other Units (Optional)**  
   By default, tokens are stored in pixels (px), but you can also convert them to:
   - **Points (pt)**
   - **Rem (rem)**
   - **Em (em)**

9. **Export Size Tokens**  
   The script exports your size tokens in Tokens Studio format as JSON files, making them ready for integration into your design system.

10. **Generate CSS & SCSS Files**  
    Automatically create CSS and SCSS files with your size tokens as variables:
    - **CSS**: Stored in `outputs/css/size/size_variables.css`
    - **SCSS**: Stored in `outputs/scss/size/size_variables.scss`
