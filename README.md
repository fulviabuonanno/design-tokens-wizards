# color-tokens-crafter üé®

Hello, Design System aficionados! üëã Welcome to **color-tokens-crafter** ‚Äî a script that helps you **craft color tokens** in just a few simple steps. Whether you're working with HEX, RGB, RGBA, or HSL formats, this tool streamlines the process, saving you time and effort. Let's dive in!

### üöÄ **Features: Version 1.0.**

1. **Select a Base Color**  
   Start by entering a base color, typically in **HEX format** (e.g., `#FABADA`).

2. **Generate Color Stops**  
   Automatically generate **6 color stops** (lightest, lighter, light, dark, darker, darkest) based on your base color. Say goodbye to manually calculating these variations!

3. **Multiple Format Outputs**  
   By default, your color is saved in **HEX** format, but you can also generate files in **RGB, RGBA, and HSL** formats. Choose what fits your needs!

4. **Tokens Studio Export**  
   The script exports your color tokens in **Tokens Studio format** for easy integration with your design system. Get your **JSON files** ready for import!

5. **Batch Processing**  
   Now you can process multiple base colors in one go. Simply provide a list of colors, and the script will generate tokens for each one.

6. **Customizable Naming Conventions**  
   Define your own naming conventions and structures for tokens to better fit your design system.

3. **Define Concept & Variant**  
   You'll be asked to provide a name for the **concept** (e.g., `primary`, `ui-background`, etc.) and an optional **variant** (e.g., `light`, `dark`). Press **Enter** to skip if not needed.

4. **Choose Output Formats**  
   Decide whether you want to generate **RGB**, **RGBA**, or **HSL** formats alongside the default HEX. Press **Enter** to skip any formats you don't need.
