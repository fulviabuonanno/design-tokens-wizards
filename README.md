Hello, Design System aficionados! üëã Welcome to **color-tokens-wizard** ‚Äî a script that helps you **craft color tokens** in just a few simple steps... Just like magic!
Whether you're working with HEX, RGB, RGBA, or HSL formats, this tool streamlines the process, saving you time and effort. Let's dive in and ride this unicorn! ü¶Ñ

### üöÄ **Features: Version 1.1.**

1. **Select a Base Color**  
   Start by entering a base color, typically in **HEX format** (e.g., `#FABADA`).

2. **Generate Color Stops**  
   Automatically generate **6 color stops** (lightest, lighter, light, dark, darker, darkest) based on your base color. Say goodbye to manually calculating these variations!

3. **Multiple Format Outputs**  
   By default, your color is saved in **HEX** format, but you can also generate files in **RGB, RGBA, and HSL** formats. Choose what fits your needs!

4. **Tokens Studio Export**  
   The script exports your color tokens in **Tokens Studio format** for easy integration with your design system. Get your **JSON files** ready for import!

5. **Batch Processing**  
   Now you can process multiple base colors in one go. Simply provide a list of colors, and the script will generate tokens for each one.

6. **Customizable Naming Conventions**  
   Define your own naming conventions and structures for tokens to better fit your design system.

7. **CSS & SCSS files with color tokens as variables**  
   Have your tokens converted and ready to be used in your dev project.
