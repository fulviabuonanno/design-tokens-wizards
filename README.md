### 3. **Enter a HEX Color**  
When prompted, input your base HEX color (e.g., `#FABADA`). If you‚Äôre unsure about the format, feel free to check the example!

### 4. **Define Concept & Modifier**  
You‚Äôll be asked to name your color‚Äôs **concept** (e.g., `brand`, `feedback`) and **modifier** (e.g., `primary`, `secondary`, `01`, `02`). This helps categorize your tokens.
